# Power-Electronics-Project
Solar Charger v0.1 (WIP)

This project includes a brief description of the project, documentation of what has happened,
KiCAD files and an LTSpice simulation files.

Project Documentation also includes the issues for this project.

For the simulation, you can change the value of the input voltage to around 5.8 to 6.1 V.
The initial simulation has C4 at 0.1 uF. Change that to 10 pF and if the input voltage
is above 6 V, it should output a voltage of 5 V.
